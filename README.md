# Implementation of Javascript Hangman API 

createGuess function has been fully implemented to handle both upper and lower case letters as valid guesses.

A delete endpoint has also been added.

All request handlers have been successfully tested using Postman

Unfortunately I ran out of time to create unit tests.  I am unfamiliar with the Jest framework but will use this as a platform to learn this.
